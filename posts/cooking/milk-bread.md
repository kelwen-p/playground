### This matters to me because...
This is my first loaf of bread that I've made. Of course, I wanted to try something not as simple, and the need to create a [tangzhong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_roux) made this a bit more complex than just kneading and proofing bread dough. On top of that, I really like the stringy-ness and texture that comes from this one more than just normal white bread. I'm excited to make more.  

### Ingredients
* Whole Milk
* Water
* Bread Flour
* Salt
* Sugar
* Egg
* Butter

### 2 Comments
* I might be overkneading the dough on the stand mixer. It took roughly 30 minutes for me to successfully knead it, where most recipes seem to say 10-15 minutes. I might be too timid to just crank up the settings. Baby steps.
* Proofing is super important. I think I didn't let it proof long enough, since the bottom of the bread feels a bit denser. I think another reason is that I didn't let the active dry yeast to bloom. The recipes asked for instant yeast, though I didn't have any. I tried to let it bloom, but probably not long enough. Hoping to keep that in mind in a future iteration. 
* (Bonus) The loaf looks like a butt, lol.

### 2 Learnings
* The amount of research one does can only go so far. I need to get my hands dirty and try it out myself. The pricier alternative is to take cooking classes to learn from a professional. That'll streamline the learning and failing process, but it still takes time. Bread making is a prime exmaple of that. Perhaps three times is what's needed to have some understanding of how to do it.
* Be patient with kneading dough. If the dough still feels a bit sticky, just let it knead a bit more. I have a stand mixer too, so that should be easier.
