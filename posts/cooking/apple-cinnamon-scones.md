### This matters to me because...
Scones are one of the main pastries/baked goods that I would look for in a coffee shop or bakery. The best thing about them is that they're not as sweet and fatty than muffin or croissant, and while some of them can be quite large and filling, I find them more pleasant. Not the most popular opinion, but I prefer them over the more popular, indulgent pastries. I yet again tried to incorporate some health-conscious substitutes, but at least this time, it less over-the-top. 

### Ingredients
* Flour
* Butter
* Greek yogurt
* Brown sugar
* Apples
* Cinnamon
* Baking powder
* Almond milk
* Vanilla

### 2 Comments
* I was conscious of making sure that the dough wasn't being overworked when I was mixing and shaping the dough (batter?). The purpose is to minimize the amount of gluten in the dough, and we didn't want it to get too warm. 
* Apples, cinnamon, butter, and sugar is such a simple list of ingredients, but they work so perfectly in tandem. I loved the flavor of the scones, and given that scones aren't typically super sweet, it was fine to not add much sugar, which are my common tendencies anyway. 


### 2 Learnings
* I learned that scones and biscuits are fairly similar in the ingredients; the main difference is the texture and the proportions between butter, flour, and liquids. Biscuits have more butter in them, while scones are have a crumb-like texture that comes from things like heavy cream, which weigh them down. I guess that's why greek yogurt is a fine substitute, since that is denser. 
* Scones (like all baked goods) are freshest and best eaten the day they're baked. It's hard to keep them at room temperature overnight or the day afterwards. Unfortunately, I didn't have the foresight to store some in the fridge before it was too late. Portion control and plan ahead.
