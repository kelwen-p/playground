### This matters to me because...
I've had lap cheong, and I've had my fair share of fried rice, but I've never done both together. I grew up eating lap cheong that was steamed in the rice cooker with white rice. This dish is a different take on it. 

### Ingredients
* Leftover white rice
* Lap cheong
* Onions
* Garlic
* Ginger
* Scallion
* Egg
* Salt
* Chinese dark soy sauce


### 2 Comments
* I overfried the lap cheong. There was a bit of charring in some pieces, but it was still good. I like the steaming version more. There's a time and place for boht, but I'm more inclined for the steamed version--most likely because it's healthier.
* I beat the egg and mixed it with the leftover rice before reheating it in the wok. I couldn't see any egg bits (since they were all coated), but I really enjoyed how it wasn't as easy to make the rice soggy. Normally, I would fry a beaten egg first before stirring the rice.

### 2 Learnings
* Patting down the rice flat and allowing the heat of the wok leave some crunchy bits leaves a nice contrast in textures that ameks it for a fun, interesting bowl of fried rice. The crunchy bits of lap cheong also help contribute to that. Maybe it's nice that I slightly overfried it. That reminds me: I should've added cashews to my fried rice as well!
* I like eggs enough that frying one beaten egg in the beginning and mixing another beaten egg with the leftover rice before stirring would work well for me! Probably not the best for everyone, but it works for me!
