### This matters to me because...

This soup reminds me of home. For holidays and bigger occasions, my family would cook a huge pot of this soup. I loved the textural differences you get from the pork rind, chicken, mushroom, and corn (which is omitted this time around). A couple years ago, a YouTube channel I followed showed how they made it. Considering that my parents are from the same streets as this person, I knew I wanted to create this dish myself. 

### Ingredients
* Water
* Fried pork skin (浮皮)
* Chicken breast
* Chicken thighs
* Dried baby shrimp (虾米)
* Reconstituted shiitake mushrooms
* Cornstarch
* Salt
* Sugar
* Sesame Oil
* Egg

### 2 Comments
* When I ladled that first bowl of soup, the aromas that filled the air--peak nostalgia.
* My parents added a can of corn. It added some sweetness and thickness to the soup that I did find missing. I'll need to add that soon enough.

### 2 Learnings
* Making the egg drop isn't as easy as I thought. Easy to cook but not to make pretty. Some foreshadowing, but I'll be making more egg drop this month!
* Sharp knives are extremely important for thinly slicing things. I luckily didn't get cut, but I definitely should invest in upgrading my knife-sharpening equipment.
