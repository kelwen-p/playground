### This matters to me because...

It was one of the few dishes that is familiar to my Asian taste buds but also aligned with my macros/diet needs. A common dish when I was meal prepping right after college, I would add some chicken breast pieces (鸡丁) to fortify the macros, but it was so easy to eat with rice. I often forget about it, since it's so simple, but I devoure it each time I make it.

### Ingredients
* Tomatoes
* Eggs
* Garlic
* Vegetable Oil
* Salt
* Sugar
* Cornstarch
* Sesame Oil


### 2 Comments
* Since it's the middle of winter, tomatoes aren't the freshest but I actually liked that it wasn't as juicy when I was cutting them. It made it easy to control how sauce the dish was.
* Having a wok to cook this make the cooking time even faster. All-in-all, it took probably 15 minutes to cook the entire dish. Maybe that's why I like cooking with a wok so much.

### 2 Learnings
* Simplicity is great for this. Not adding chicken breast (unsurprisingly) made the textures and tastes better. I don't think there's a need to add or alter this in any way. It's like Aglio e Olio--a few, simple ingredients is all it takes to make a great dish. Don't ruin it.
* Don't be afraid of using a bit more oil when stir-frying in a wok. It makes it so much easier to cook things. Also, knowing my own tendencies, it's extremely hard to go overboard with fats to the point that it affects my macros. 

### References

I didn't look at any recipes, since I learned this from my dad while working at the restaurant. I'll still do my due diligence and add some here though.

Reading through those references, maybe I should've looked at them beforehand. I like the idea of adding some scallions in the mix for sweetness and contrast.
