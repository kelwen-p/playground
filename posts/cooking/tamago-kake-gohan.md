### This matters to me because...
I have seen a few YouTube videos on tamago kake gohan, and given that I'm a sucker for adding raw eggs to my food (yukhoe being one of them), I just had to give it a try. The simplicity also was a huge factor. That being said, I also pasteurized my own eggs by submerging the eggs in a 140-degree fahrenheit water bath for a while. New techniques also helped. 

### Ingredients
* Cooked white rice
* Eggs
* Soy sauce
* Salt
* Sugar
* Furikake (the one with bonito flakes)


### 2 Comments
* The pasteurizing eggs isn't that difficult, though having an instant-read thermometer helped a lot. It took probably 15 minutes, end-to-end, but I had to be present, since I wanted to continually stir the eggs to distribute the temperature evenly. I did notice that egg yolk was starting to firm up just slightly when I cracked it. It was still amazing though.
* Furikake is amazing. It's a great contract from the richness and heartiness that comes from the rice and eggs. Texturally it also gives some contrast, since it's dried and has some crunchiness to it. Another way of easily enhacing cooked rice in my arsenal! 

### 2 Learnings
* The ratio of egg to white rice is important. I used jumbo eggs when mixing the rice, and I noticed the rice was a bit soggier than what I would've expected. It was still good, but there was a point when the rice was too slimey. Adding the egg yolk at the top felt excessive at that point. Still devoured it though. 
* If I'm using leftover rice, make sure to loosen up the grains before re-heating them. Rice naturally clumps up, and doing that beforehand makes it much easier to ensure all rice grains are coated with the egg. Also, use a larger bowl to mix the egg and rice and create a divet in the center for the egg to allow for even distribution of coating the egg.
