### This matters to me because...

In May 2021, this was the dish I had at [The Buffs](https://thebuffsny.com/) when I flew out to New York City to find an apartment as part of moving back to the city. Despite it being the hottest day of the entire month, I thoroughly enjoyed the dish. A couple hours later, I toured an apartment that eventually became the one that moved into. I still think of that dish, so I made it myself! 


### Ingredients
* Leftover rice
* Chicken breast
* Shrimp
* Pineapple
* Green bell peppers
* Onion
* Egg
* Scallions
* Walnuts
* Fish sauce
* Salt
* Sugar
* Soy sauce
* Shaoxing Wine


### 2 Comments
* The cashew nuts were unique to my Chinese-influenced taste buds. I don't think I can go back without having them in my fried rice now, at least for base sauces with strong flavors like fish sauce. 
* Fried rice can definitely be a "clean out my fridge" dish. Doesn't mean I shouldn't salt my food though...

### 2 Learnings
* Following the ingredients line-by-line is important, but if you don't have in-season ingredients, you can always substitute in a pinch. It won't be perfect, but it'll get close. Frozen pineapples did that for me.
* Don't use frozen cooked shrimp if you plan on cooking them again. I got them at a reduced price, so I used them, but they had no texture whatsoever after re-cooking them. Not worth.
