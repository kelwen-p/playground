### This matters to me because...
This is another easy, macro-friendly dish that I wanted to have under my arsenal. I recently got an earthenware pot, and I wanted to use it on something relatively easy. This was roughly the time when I started to feel sick, and having something so warm, filling, and healthy was just what I needed.

### Ingredients
* Eggs
* Water
* Scallions
* Dashi powder
* Sesame oil

### 2 Comments
* The bowl I used is wider than what I saw in videos and articles. That undoubtedly affects heat distribution. A smaller, narrower bowl helps maintain heat and therefore probably didn't require as much time--I needed roughly 15 minutes when most sources mentioned 10-12 minutes. 
* I love the fluffiness I get from just steaming the eggs. It's a texture I'm not familiar with. I've had lots of scrambled eggs, custards, egg drop, sunny side eggs, etc...but this was something new! 

### 2 Learnings
* Low and slow is definitely the best way. I got a bit impatient and turned the stove to medium heat. It left some browning and burnt eggs on the bottom of the bowl. Perhaps it's inevitable, but I think letting the eggs slowly cook is the best way to do it. I even smelled some some burnt eggs.
* Scallions are inherently sweet when cooked. I kind of knew that, but alliums are so cool. They have a sharp taste when eaten raw, but they become mellower and sweeter once cooked. Adding scallions on top, in additional to the sesame oil might give a different texture, but it might not be necessary. I'll try that next time.
