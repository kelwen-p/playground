### This matters to me because...
The original dish--braised beef brisket and daikon--is a staple dish that my dad made while growing up. When I went back home due to the pandemic, this was another dish that I thoroughly enjoyed and wanted to recreate. I've since made the dish a couple times on my own. However, this time around, I wanted to make it into a soup base to add some starches to it. 

### Ingredients
* Beef brisket flank
* Daikon
* Ginger
* Scallion
* Cinnamon stick
* Star anise
* Cloves
* Rock sugar
* Soy sauce
* Chu hou paste
* Oyster sauce
* Water


### 2 Comments
* I was concerned that some of the texture and taste would be different if the beef I got was formerly frozen. Quite frankly, I didn't think there was a huge difference, which I was pleasantly surprised by. It was still pretty tender, and the nice thing about the particular pieces of beef were that there was a combination of tendon and actual beef meat. I liked that there was a good ratio, rather than having one biased more than the other.
* I felt extremely comfortable while making this dish. While my countertops were still messy, and there was a lot that I needed to get done, I didn't feel like it was a rushed effort at all.

### 2 Learnings
* There are different ways to "eliminate the impurities" in meats. One quick way to is to do a quick boil of the beef, but it seems like you can also just soak them in cold water for a while. I might want to try that some day, especially when I was crunched for time and wanted to minimize effort.
* Learn to pick the right daikon. While I got this batch from a grocery delivery app, it's important to make sure that the daikon is the freshest. Otherwise, it'll get pretty bitter. Though, part of it is that I left that daikon in the fridge for over a week, and I didn't keep it in the best refrigeration conditions--I noticed that the plastic bag it was pretty wet. I also noticed some slight bruising inside the daikon.
