### This matters to me because...
It is yet another attempt to combine baking with some health-conscious twists to it. Brownies always felt like an easy thing to make--you just mix some flour, eggs, milk, cocoa powder. With the right ratios, things would look right. I substituted some of the flour for unflavored protein powder and added some greek yogurt to compensate for the added dry ingredients. 

### Ingredients
* Flour
* Butter
* Vanilla Extract
* Coffee
* Salt
* Eggs
* Chocolate bar (chopped)
* Sugar
* Brown sugar
* Protein powder
* Greek yogurt


### 2 Comments
* The chopped chocolate chunks were the saving grace of this brownie. Otherwise, the texture was a hybrid of being floury and crumb-like. It was just extremely dense and dry. Having it with coffee did make to go down easier though, and it felt like it could keep in the fridge for a fair bit of time. 
* I found it disturbing to see some liquid on the sides of the baking pan when I took out the parchment paper and brownies to cool off. Perhaps it's my impression that baking = dry, but the amount of liquid (presumably built-up steam) was a bit strange. I noticed that in other baking recipes, so perhaps it's just a 

### 2 Learnings
* Ratios are extremely important. The ratio of dry-to-wet ingredients determines whether something is a cake, cookie, or bar. Don't skimp on those when baking. This is the second time I've gone rogue with baking, and it pretty much ruined the entire dish. 
* Just adding random protein powder to the mix won't cut it. I think I also added 2 or 3 scoops... the ratios were just totally off. Perhaps I should have substituted all-purpose flour with some coconut flour and decreased the protein powder amount. This would at least increase the ratio of flour-to-protein powder.
