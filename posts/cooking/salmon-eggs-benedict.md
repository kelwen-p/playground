### This matters to me because...
Eggs benedict was one of the first western dishes that I saw as special--even high-end to a certain degree. I grew up having weekend brunches at chain diners like Denny's and Perkins, so eggs benedict definitely felt like a luxury compared to the Grand Slam Breakfasts and Everything Omelettes. The first time I had it was at the Sofitel in Bloomington, which was considered fancy in my mind. Since venturing to New York, I've had my fair share of eggs benedict, but I wanted to try to make it myself. 

I've also heard making hollandaise sauce was difficult and tedious, and I'm always down for a good challenge. Same with poaching an egg.

### Ingredients
###### Hollandaise Sauce
* Egg yolks
* Lemon
* Butter
* Salt
* Cayenne

###### Everything Else
* English Muffin
* Smoked Salmon
* Hollandaise Sauce
* Eggs
* Scallions
* Cayenne

### 2 Comments
* There's so much butter in a hollandaise sauce. It's very rich and decadent, but after seeing how much I added to my own sauce, I've come to realize this isn't the kind of sauce for me. I felt a certain amount of disgust as I was whisking in the butter. At least the the hollandaise didn't break!
* I'm pleasantly surprised by how much I like English muffins. The "nooks and crannies" texture that comes from English muffins is super fun to eat, and I look forward to making that a staple in my grocery shopping list. The only problem is that, like all breads, they go stale relatively quickly. 

### 2 Learnings
* I should know this, but toasting an English muffin on a pan and using a toaster are two entirely different things. I didn't add any oil on the pan, and I think it made it more difficult to distribute heat. Convection heating and conduction heating are two widely different ways of cooking.
* Ideally I should use a larger pot of boiling water when poaching an egg. I use a 4-quart pot to poach an egg, and while it worked, I felt like I was going to bump into the egg whenever I was stirring the pot of boiling water. The first egg I poached was cooking on the bottom of the pot.
