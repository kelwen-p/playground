### This matters to me because...

I went to [Marble Dessert Bar](https://www.mmarbledessertbar.com/) last year, and one of their dishes was a dessert rendition of Tom Kha. Rather than using chicken as the main "protein", they had this carrot sorbet. I've been wanting to try the original soup itself, so this is was my attempt at that.

### Ingredients
* Coconut milk
* Galangal
* Kaffir lime leaves
* Lemongrass
* Thai chili peppers
* Tomatoes
* Shallots
* Cilantro
* Boneless, skinless chicken thighs
* Shimeji mushrooms
* Fish sauce
* Lime
* Scallions
* Sugar
* Salt

### 2 Comments
* I definitely don't add enough salt to my dishes. Perhaps I'm being health-conscious, but it's also probably due to my Cantonese influences. My work-in-progress.
* Handling so many new ingredients (galangal, kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass, coconut milk) was overwhelming, and I found myself following the recipes more strictly than when I cook other dishes. 

### 2 Learnings
* Galangal is extremely woody, despite it looking almost identical to ginger. Need to be extremely careful when chopping those up.
* Don't touch your face at all when handling thai chili peppers. I itched my nose, and the after effects were painful.
