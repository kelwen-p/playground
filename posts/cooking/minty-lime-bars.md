### This matters to me because...
A friend went on a second date with someone, and the guy made these lime bars, which were heavily based on a YouTube video that I have also watched. I made a verbal commitment that I would make them (and also hoped to get some brownie points for my friend's date--they're still together at the time of posting this), so here we are. 

### Ingredients
* Unsalted butter
* Lime/lime zest
* Sugar, confectioner's and granulated
* All-purpose flour
* Fresh mint
* Baking powder
* Salt
* Eggs
* Cornstarch
* Lemon


### 2 Comments
* Making lime/lemon curd fillings isn't as difficult as I thought. I maybe was a bit more cautious when dissolving the sugar and heating up the pan, but I'm glad it turned out well.
* I couldn't taste the mint. Perhaps it's because it wasn't fresh enough, or I didn't add enough of it. I did get the mint about a week before I made it, so that might've contributed to the fragrance absence. 

### 2 Learnings
* Following recipes line-by-line really helped with me getting the right consistency with the lime bars and making the shortbread layer. 
* Using a stand mixer isn't necessary for any baking thing; I'm glad I didn't need a stand mixer for this. I did get one before I started baking anything though.
