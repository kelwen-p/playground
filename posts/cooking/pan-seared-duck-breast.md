### This matters to me because...

Duck is a protein that I have little exposure to--at least cooking it. The sheer excitement I when I saw the stand at the Union Square Farmer's Market that sold duck breast was uncontainable. I didn't like venturing out to the unfamiliar, but getting duck breast opened the door to what eventually came to the idea of 31 Days of Cooking.

This was my third time trying to pan-sear a duck breast. It's accompanied by a bed of white rice, gailan, and a citrusy sauce.


### Ingredients

###### Main ingredients
* Duck Breast
* Rice
* Gailan - Chinese Broccoli

###### Sauce/seasoning
* Salt
* Pepper
* Red Wine Vinegar
* Lemon
* Water
* Sugar


### 2 Comments
* Third time's the charm--the duck breast was a perfect medium rare to me! An instant-read thermometer also helped a lot.
* I attempted to make a square rice cake from some leftover rice, but it wouldn't stick. I definitely needed a binding agent, perhaps some flour or an egg. 

### 2 Learnings
* I need a thickening agent for the sauce; it was too runny for my liking. Perhaps next time, I should make a roux with the rendered duck fat or just add butter. I couldn't make the fancy, schmancy demi-glace sauce. 
* I definitely have lots to learn about fundamentals. Things like deglazing a pan correctly, blanching vegetables, and even just timing everything...they're all things I can work on more. Baby steps...
