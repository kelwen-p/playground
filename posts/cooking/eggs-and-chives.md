### This matters to me because...
Growing up, I loved having this dish, but it was rarity in the house, since Chinese chives was considered a luxury ingredient. Now, being able to just get these ingredients whenever I want is a very humbling experience. Cooking this dish helped ground me and remind me of my upbringing. I love that.

### Ingredients
* Chinese chives
* Eggs
* Salt, kosher and maldon
* Sugar
* Oil


### 2 Comments
* Similar to [[韭菜炒鸡蛋 - Eggs with Chinese Chives]], the dish came together very quickly. Using a wok only made it even faster, since I had a larger surface area to cook all the eggs and chives.
* While it was faster to make, I also found that it was easier to burn as well. Maybe it was just the photo itself, but despite some pieces getting a bit more char, it overall didn't have that burnt taste. Success!

### 2 Learnings
* Adding fancy Maldon salt didn't help with the textures here. I wanted to try something new, but it honestly didn't work for me. Maybe it's because I wouldn't expect an extra textural element some most stir-fry dishes. The textures come from the ingredients, not from the toppings. Also, ironic that I used an expensive salt for a dish that I mention humbles me. 
* There's not need to be so opinionated with finding the perfect "egg-to-chives" ratio. At the end of the day, it's just eggs and chives, and it's good just the way it is. I think that's also the beauty of stir-frying things. You can have more or less of something, but you can usually pick out thing that you don't like (well...minus this dish, I guess).
