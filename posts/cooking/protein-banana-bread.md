### This matters to me because...

This is my first dive into baking with the intent of making things a bit more health-conscious. Health-conscious == more protein; at least that's for me. My meager attempt was by just adding some protein powder, substituting for egg whites instead of eggs. 

This was also a first, which I'm excited to have under my belt for futher baking endeavors!

### Ingredients
* Ripe bananas
* Flour
* Butter
* Eggs
* Unflavored protein powder
* Coconut sugar
* Vanilla
* Cashews
* Salt
* Cinnamon
* Dark chocolate bar


### 2 Comments
* The banana bread was vastly in need of more sugar. I forgot that the protein powder I use is unflavored, and given that I already halved the recommended amount of sugar, it made it for a pretty bland bread. I still smelled the banana flavor though, which helped with salvaging the taste.
* Adding chopped dark chocolate didn't help as much as I thought it would. The problem is because there wasn't much sugar in the bread itself, it led to an even bitter interior. Sprinkling sugar on top of each slice helped, but it definitely would've helped adding it in the batter.

### 2 Learnings
* Protein powder definitely leaves a strange texture. It became very blocky, and there was an unusual amount of moisture when I took the loaf out of the oven. I'm pretty sure that came from 
* Making the banana bread batter (dough?) was surprisingly simple. Just mix everything into a bowl. If you want to sift the dry ingredients, then go ahead, but it was great to just see how simple it was. I'm slowly getting more confortable with baking.
