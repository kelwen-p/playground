### This matters to me because...
I've attempted to make scones already, but I wanted to add some matcha flavor instead. I went a little rogue as well and added some chopped chocolate. Like I mentioned earlier, scones are one of my favorite pastries, since they're not overly sweet. 

Also, looking back this attempted, I realize that I have a lot to learn to make the best scone. This is a prime example of my need to learn proper technique when it comes to baking. It's all good though; I'm learning :) 

### Ingredients
* Flour
* Butter
* Sugar
* Salt
* Greek yogurt
* Bittersweet chocolate
* Matcha powder
* Vanilla extract
* Egg

### 2 Comments
* I'm calling this a "scone" because the texture almost felt cake-y. Perhaps it was the greek yogurt that I used as the wet binding agent. In any case, I think the tangy, lowfat qualities of greek yogurt made it for this weird texture that I don't often associate with scones. Definitely need some fats in the liquid.
* I should've a sweeter type of chocolate. The bitterness from the bittersweet chocolate was a bit too overpowering, and it became the prominent flavor throughout the scone. While it was unique, I realized that this led to a combination of bitter-on-bitter flavors, since matcha and bittersweet chocolate are both inherently bitter.

### 2 Learnings
* If the dough is getting a bit too warm, put it in the fridge, and let it cool down. I realized that I was working the butter into the dry ingredients a bit too aggressively, and it led to these "scones" not turning out the way I would like them to be. I guess my hands are inherently warm. I think I need to read up on things a bit more though...
* Don't overwork the dough! It'd lead to developing lots of gluten and become more springy; perhaps that's why I thought it had a cake-y texture. Also, led the scones sit in the fridge before baking them.
