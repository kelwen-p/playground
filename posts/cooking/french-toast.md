### This matters to me because...
I made the milk bread, and after almost a week of making it, I wanted a way of using the stale bread. French toast was the first thing that came to mind, and given that I've never made it, despite it being my go-to in a classic American breakfast, it was fitting to try it out myself. 

### Ingredients
* Milk bread
* Butter
* Almond milk
* Egg
* Sugar
* Cinnamon
* Nutmeg
* Frozen blueberries
* Water


### 2 Comments
* The toast itself in the center was a bit soggy, even after cooking it on the non-stick pan for almost 5 minutes. This tells me that I may have soaked the stale bread for a bit too long. Other possibilities are that I didn't have as much fat in the bread itself or in the soaking liquid. White bread is probably a contributing factor, since I learned that there isn't as much better incorporated into the bread to slow down the soaking process.
* I reduced the liquid in the compote too much, so there wasn't as much of a "syrup" texture to it. It ultimately give enough liquid for it to coat the entire french toast before it got soaked. It also wasn't as sweet, which tells me that most syrups have just a ton of sugar in them--I thought I added a lot of sugar, but I guess not. Still very good, though the bananas were a bit of a random afterthought that didn't work out. 

### 2 Learnings
* Get a serrated bread knife if I plan on doing more bread things. I noticed that the cuts on the bread were a bit uneven, most likely because of the serrated steak knife I used. It actually contributed to the uneven custard coating on the bread. For example, some center parts didn't seem to get any of the coating at all, and I needed to press on it. Pressing on it also probably led to some parts being overly soaked.
* I'm not sure if using frozen fruit for a compote makes any difference than fresh ones. Given that it's the winter, it's all that I had, but I figured it didn't give as intense flavors. I saw in a YouTube video that adding some kalua or alcohol in the compote gives it a deeper flavor.
