AAPI and LGBTQ communities have faced their own individual challenges against hate and discrimination. However, it is also important to explore the intersectional challenges one faces as an Asian American who identifies as LGBTQ. In fact, intersectionality advocates argue that the experience of being part of two minority groups, like being an LGBTQ Asian American, faces unique and more difficult challenges than the combined challenges of being only LGBTQ or only being an Asian American. On top of that, there is a growing number of LGBTQ AAPI in the US. In a 2014 study at University of California, Los Angeles, roughly 1 in 3 documented LGBTQ immigrants are Asians, and in another study, it is estimated that LGBTQ AAPI communities are four times more likely to experience mental distress than their non-LGBTQ counterparts. In 2015, a study found that the unemployment rate of LGBTQ AAPI individuals is twice the US’s unemployment rate.

Many Asian countries have had a long history of LGBTQ in society. For example, the Golden Orchid Society existed during the Qing Dynasty, which created a space where women could marry other women. Thailand has had a history of transgender popularity, now often seen on TV shows and in popular entertainment. In South Asian countries, the term _hijra_ describes transgender and non-binary people, and its usage has existed since the 1600s. Note that despite there being a long history of LGBTQ in society, this does not mean that it has been an acceptable part of society. Accounts of discrimination and hatred against these communities may still have occurred, but there have since been havens for LGBTQ to create form groups to cope with their identities. 

LGBTQ AAPI in the 21st century has since come a long way in the US, and their contributions across America’s societal tapestry only continue to be more widespread. In 2012, Mark Takano of California became the first openly LGBTQ person of color to serve in the US Congress and Kim Coco Iwamoto became the highest ranging transgender AAPI American in 2006, serving in the Hawai’i Board of Education. In the entertainment industry, figures like Margaret Cho and BD Wong continue to share their experiences as an LGBTQ AAPI American. In sports, athletes continue to come out, such as former-NFL player Esera Tuaolo and 2002 Olympic ice hockey player Julie Chu. 

For those who are struggling, questioning, or just curious about identities as AAPI and LGBTQ, know that you are not alone. There is a plethora of resources to help support those who need help navigating through these challenges.
