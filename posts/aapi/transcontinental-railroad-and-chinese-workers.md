"The Chinese workers were not just the footnote that many histories of the Transcontinental Railroad relegate them to. Nothing like the railroad had ever been done in the world. Without the Chinese railroad workers it could not have been done. “

The Transcontinental Railroad was the US’s biggest project in the 19th century to connect its East and West Coasts. Chinese workers and migrants contributed to the vast majority of the construction on the West Coast. The Central Pacific Railroad was the company responsible for constructing the railroad from Sacramento, California to Ogden Utah. 

In many parts, Chinese workers were 90% of the workforce, and their diligence and work ethic led to them completing their part of the railroad over five years ahead of schedule. Despite their widespread contributions, Chinese workers experienced wage inequalities and were exposed to more dangerous parts of the construction process. The cost of a Chinese worker was less than their white counterparts by a third. Part of this came from paying Chinese workers lower wages than whtie workers, but the Central Pacific Railroad also did not provide lodging and board for Chinese workers. 

Chinese workers fought back to combat these inequalities. One major strike that caught the attention of the manager of Central Pacific Railroad, Charles Crocker, was the strike in the Sierra mountains near Cisco. Several thousands of workers dropped their tools and refused to work, staying in their camps all day. Workers protested on “the right of the overseers of the company to either whip them or restrain them from leaving the road when they desire to seek other employment.” This draws harrowing parallels to slavery and the freedom of mobility, as workers claim that they were forced to continue working and had no option to leave.

The nature of the strike was different from most strikes made by Whites. Chinese workers were seen staying at their camps, remaining silent, and refusing to work. As Crocker describes it, “they would come out and walk around, but not a word was said. No violence was perpetrated along the whole line.” Yet, it caught the attention of the Central Pacific Railroad. To combat, Crocker denied food and transportation for those going on strike, and he worked with local sheriffs to threaten violence against strike leaders if they continued refusing to work. Ultimately, out of fear of starvation and violence, Chinese workers began working on the railroad once more. No concessions from the Central Pacific Railroad were made to Chinese workers. While this proved that workers were smart enough to organize strikes and stand up for themselves, this led to little substantive change. Crocker did not increase wages or provide board but did concede to not lower wages for workers. 

Chinese workers were not treated like white workers in the US throughout any stage of the Transcontinental Railroad. They were imported and traded to the US, with no expectation of being granted housing, food, and jobs after the completion of the railroad. Treatment during the construction reflected conditions of indentured servitude, and Chinese workers received little recognition. The iconic picture at Promontory, Utah had not a single Chinese worker in the frame. Many workers chose to stay in the US afterwards, settling in major cities such as San Francisco. However, alienation against Chinese workers continued, sowing seeds for what eventually became the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.
